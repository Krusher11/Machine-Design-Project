Thickener system

The following 3 files are 2 PDF's of the IDW files of a Thickener system that 3 other Engineers and I designed for Machine Design 314 and a report detailing the design procedure and calculations that were done. The full assembly is one of the pdf's while the other is the mounting frame I designed for the project. A full force analysis, stress analysis and material selection was done for each of the parts. The whole procedure is dictated in the design report attached. This project taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, delegation, time management and compromise. Not a lot of guidence was given for this project and so quite a bit of self study was needed to complete it. In the moment this was daunting but in hindsight, I am glad that we had full autonomy over this project. The skill of finding applicable information and the ability to discern whether information is relevant/useful is rarely taught but is vital for an Engineer. I am open to any constructive criticism and guidence as to where I could potentially improve my design.

Thank you so much.
